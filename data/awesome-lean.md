# Awesome Lean Programming [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Dependently typed functional programming language and interactive theorem prover.

[Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/) is largely written in Lean, it compiles to C, and it can prove things about the programs you write in it. Most existing lists focus on formalized mathematics. This one looks at Lean from a programmer's point of view: libraries, tooling, program verification, interop, and software that people have actually built.
